The goal of this project is to predict whether the stockmarket value will rise or fall based on the daily news from top 25 news outlets. The data used for this project is obtained from Kaggle datasets which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews
The file **stockMarketAndNewsData.csv** contains all the required data. The columns in the data include date, label (wheher the stock value inclreased or droped), and Top1-Top25 for the text of the daily top 25 news headlines.

The solution is developed on pyspark, using Random Forest predictive model.
